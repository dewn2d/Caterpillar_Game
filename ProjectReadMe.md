1) 	a) my program consists of multiple classes; Dewn2dCaterpillar, gameTimer, caterpillarModel 
	b)
	c) gameTimer class is an abstract class gameTimer.java
	d) in the FoodPackage package, food.java is an interface 
	
2) 	a) in caterpillarModel I used an ArrayList for the body of the caterpillarModel and directions. found in caterpillarModel line
	31 and 32 used throughout the class
	b) in FXMLDocumentController.java Exception handling was used when switching scenes  to the about scene and leaderboard scene in 
	aboutAction and leaderAction also in LeaderboardFXMLController.java for fileahandling 
	
3)  	the project uses MVC with FXMLDocumentController.java being the center

4)	the program utilizes 3 scenes one for the game, one for the about page and one for the leaderboard
	the game has a menu anchor pane that is is hidden when the game has started and reappears when
	escape is pressed or the game has ended.
	
5)	The about scene is accessed by clicking the about button in the menu which can be found in about action in FXMLDocumentController

6)	saving and loading is implemented in the leaderboarFXMLController the score and name is saved
	to a file and loaded when the player goes the leaderboard scene which is found in leaderAction in FXMLDocumentcontroller
